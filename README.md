## Welcome to my "Design an A/B Test" Project Page!

I completed this project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree "A/B Testing" course.

In this course, I learned how to do the following things:

- Select metrics to evaluate a proposed change
- Characterize and validate those metrics
- Plan an appropriate duration for your experiment based on the number of samples needed and the expected risk
- Sanity check the results to make sure everything went smoothly
- Draw a conclusion based on the results
- Recommend whether or not to launch the change

For this project, I considered an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. I fleshed out the experiment idea into a fully defined design, analyzed the results, recommended a decision, and proposed a high-level follow-up experiment. I also designed an A/B test, including a hypothesis, unit of diversion, and which metrics to measure.

A PDF file of the project can be found by clicking the "View on GitHub" link above.

Enjoy!
